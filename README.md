# DodgeAsteroids 4

4th iteration of the DodgeAsteroids environment.
New feature: steering within drift sections is not possible.
This is supposed to prompt participants to efficiently plan ahead / project.
We explore how participants prepare themselves for upcoming drift sections 
(i.e. horizontal positioning)
